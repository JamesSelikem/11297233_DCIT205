# DCIT_205_IA

 10 page website for the university of Ghana computer science department.

Welcome to UG Replica! This project is a recreation of the University of Ghana's website, aiming to provide a simulated experience of the university's online presence. Whether you're a developer eager to explore the code or a user interested in experiencing a virtual version of the University of Ghana's website, this README will guide you through the setup and provide insights into the project.

Cloning the Repository
 1 Fork the Repository: Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the repository page. This creates a copy  of the repository in your GitHub account.
 2 Clone Your Forked Repository: On your forked repository page, click the "Code" button. Copy the HTTPS or SSH URL (depending on your preference). Open your terminal or command prompt on your local machine. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository using the cd command. bash Copy code cd path/to/directory Run the following command to clone the repository: bash Copy code git clone 
 https://github.com/JamesSelikem/11297233_DCIT205.git
 3 Navigate to the Cloned Directory: bash Copy code cd repository-name
 4 Add the Original Repository as a Remote: This step allows you to keep your fork updated with changes from the original repository. bash Copy code git remote add upstream 
 https://github.com/JamesSelikem/11297233_DCIT205.git
 5 Create a Branch: bash Copy code git checkout -b feature-branch Replace "feature-branch" with a descriptive branch name related to the changes you plan to make.
 6 Make Changes: Make your desired changes to the project files. Add, modify, or delete files as needed.
 7 Commit Changes: bash Copy code git add . git commit -m "Your meaningful commit message"
 8 Push Changes to Your Fork: bash Copy code git push origin feature-branch
 9 Create a Pull Request: Go to your forked repository on GitHub. Click on the "Pull Requests" tab. Click the "New Pull Request" button. Choose the base repository and branch where you want to merge your changes. Write a meaningful title and description for your pull request. Click on the "Create Pull Request" button. Your pull request is now submitted. It will be reviewed by the repository owner or maintainers. If changes are requested, make the updates locally, commit them, and push again to the same branch. The pull request will automatically update.
 These steps cover the basic process of cloning a repository, making changes, and creating a pull request. Adjustments may be needed based on the specific project or repository instructions.
