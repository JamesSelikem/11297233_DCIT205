						<h3>MPhil. Computer Science: Level 600<br>First Semester</h3>
						<p>
                            In the postgraduate program, our department focuses on advanced research and specialized knowledge. 
                            The first semester offers foundational courses like Research Methods and Advanced Data Structures 
                            and Algorithms. Principles of Wireless and Mobile Systems provide a deep dive into contemporary 
                            technologies. Elective choices include Advanced Computer Networks, Advanced Database Systems, 
                            Advanced Operating Systems, and Human-Computer Interaction, allowing students to tailor their 
                            studies to their research interests. This semester sets the stage for a rigorous exploration of 
                            cutting-edge concepts and methodologies, preparing students for leadership roles in academia, 
                            research, and industry.

						<h3>Second semester</h3>
						<p>
                            In the second semester of our postgraduate program, the focus shifts towards advanced applications 
                            and in-depth research. Advanced Software Engineering, Distributed Systems, and Seminar I provide a 
                            comprehensive understanding of cutting-edge technologies. Intelligent Systems further explores the 
                            realm of artificial intelligence. Electives such as Bioinformatics, Advanced Computer Vision, Wireless 
                            Systems Design, and Networks Security allow students to delve into specialized areas. The semester 
                            culminates with Computational Mathematics and the initiation of the MPhil Thesis, offering students 
                            an opportunity to contribute to the body of knowledge in computer science through original research. 
                            This semester prepares students for the culmination of their postgraduate journey.
